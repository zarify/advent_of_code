Every year I tell myself I'll use AoC to learn something new and every year I bail and use Python instead.

Since I've been wrapping my head around pandas recently, and some of the AoC problems start out looking like
nice tabular data (at first blush anyway) I thought I'd have a go at reinforcing some memory of pandas methods
and try out a pandas solution as well as a regular Python one where I can.
